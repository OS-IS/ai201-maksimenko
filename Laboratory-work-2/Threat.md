This may lead to a denial of service attack against Computer Application or an elevation of privilege attack against Computer Application or an information disclosure by Computer Application. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach. |

Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |                                                                             |
